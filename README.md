- 👋 Hi, I’m @MelWise
- 👀 I’m interested in books, design, plants, and all things typography related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning epub design/publishing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I teach myself whatever strikes my hyperfixation. If I seem cool, let's chat.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send a note in a bottle.
- 😄 Pronouns: They/Them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have 2 aquatic newts (<i>Pleurodeles waltl</i>) named Bougie and Baby and they make life better.
